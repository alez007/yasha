# bench — modelship vs vanilla-loader A/B harness

Two-phase benchmark that runs `vllm bench serve` against a **modelship**
loader, then against the **vanilla server it wraps** (raw `vllm serve`, or a
bare `llama-server` subprocess) from the *same Docker image* with the same
engine config, and diffs throughput, latency, and memory.

This measures modelship's own wrapping overhead — Ray Serve, the gateway, the
loader's proxy layer — not one inference stack against another. `--loader`
picks which wrapped stack to measure (`vllm` or `llama_server`); `--device`
picks GPU vs CPU for that stack. The four combinations:

| `--loader` | `--device` | config | baseline |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `vllm` | `gpu` (default) | `configs/vllm-gpu.yaml` | raw `vllm serve` on GPU |
| `vllm` | `cpu` | `configs/vllm-cpu.yaml` | raw `vllm serve` on the CPU backend |
| `llama_server` | `gpu` | `configs/llama-gpu.yaml` | vanilla `llama-server`, fully GPU-offloaded |
| `llama_server` | `cpu` | `configs/llama-cpu.yaml` | vanilla `llama-server`, CPU-only |

## Prerequisites

- `docker` and `curl` on the host.
- For `--device gpu`: the NVIDIA container runtime (`--gpus all` must work) and `nvidia-smi`.
- A built modelship image. Default tag is `modelship:dev` (CUDA) / `modelship:dev-cpu`
  (CPU) — override with `--image`. CUDA and CPU are separate image variants
  (`--build-arg MSHIP_VARIANT=cuda|cpu`, see the root `Dockerfile`); the `cpu`
  variant is required for `--device cpu` (it ships the `vllm==...+cpu` wheel).

## Run

```bash
bench/run.sh                                        # vllm on GPU (default): 100 prompts, conc 8, in/out 128/512, 20 warmups, 3 repeats
bench/run.sh --loader vllm --device cpu
bench/run.sh --loader llama_server --device gpu
bench/run.sh --loader llama_server --device cpu
bench/run.sh --loader vllm --image modelship:dev --concurrency 32 --num-prompts 500
```

`--num-warmups N` (default 20) sends warmup requests that are discarded before
timing so cold-start (CUDA graph capture / compilation / first-request JIT)
doesn't skew the result. `--repeats N` (default 3) runs the sweep N times per
stack; the summary reports the **median** so a single noisy run can't dominate.
`--config PATH` overrides the config file picked by `--loader`/`--device`.

Tunable env vars (forwarded to the modelship phase):

- `MSHIP_GATEWAY_REPLICAS` (default 1) — gateway replica count.
- `MSHIP_GATEWAY_MAX_ONGOING` (default 1024) — gateway per-replica concurrency cap.
- `MSHIP_CACHE_DIR` — model cache to reuse across phases (default `./models-cache`).

The model and the per-model `max_ongoing_requests` cap come from the config
file (`configs/vllm-gpu.yaml`, `configs/vllm-cpu.yaml`, `configs/llama-gpu.yaml`,
or `configs/llama-cpu.yaml`).

## Output

Each run writes a timestamped dir under `bench/results/` (gitignored) containing
`result_<n>.json` (one per repeat, per phase), `mem.tsv`, `prom.txt`,
`components.txt`, container logs, and a `summary.md` whose tables show the
**median across repeats**. The two phase subdirectories are always named
`modelship` and `baseline` regardless of `--loader`/`--device`.

`summary.md` also breaks the modelship container's memory down per Ray process
(from `components.txt`, scraped from the reporter agent on port 8079): a
**per-component memory** table ranks `ray::*` model-serving actors and the
control-plane processes (`gcs_server`, `raylet`, `agent`, `ProxyActor`,
`ServeController`) by private memory (USS), with shared *libraries* (torch/CUDA,
mapped into every worker — not plasma) reported separately so they aren't charged
to any one actor. This attributes the host-RAM overhead — model-serving actor vs
fixed Ray control plane. The snapshot is the **peak-private scrape sampled during
the sweep** (not the idle post-sweep state); modelship-only, since the baseline
stack has no Ray. Note this table **undercounts** the true total: the Ray
reporter sees only Ray worker PIDs, so a loader's own inference subprocess
(vLLM's `EngineCore`, or the `llama-server` child) is missing — the
reconciliation below quantifies the gap. Trust cgroup `anon` for the absolute
number.

Two cross-checks back this up:

- **cgroup `memory.stat` breakdown** — `mem.tsv` records, per second for *both*
  stacks, the kernel's own accounting: `anon` (real process RSS), `shmem`
  (tmpfs/plasma — Ray's object store, charged to the cgroup but to no process),
  and `file` (reclaimable page cache). The memory table reports the peak of each,
  so the modelship-vs-baseline RSS gap is attributed to real memory vs plasma vs cache.
- **reporter-vs-cgroup reconciliation** — the per-component section compares the
  Ray reporter's Σ private/shared (a second-hand Prometheus gauge that can be
  stale) against cgroup `anon`/`shmem` (ground truth). A `⚠️ diverges` flag means
  the reporter numbers are suspect and shouldn't be quoted. (vLLM and llama-server
  each expose their own `/metrics` too, but only engine stats — no per-process
  memory — which is why the cgroup numbers are the only cross-stack memory signal.)

## Results

### vllm / GPU

Example run — 1×GPU, Qwen2.5-7B-AWQ, `--loader vllm --device gpu`, 100 prompts @ concurrency 8, median of 3:

| metric | modelship | raw vllm | overhead |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| throughput (req/s) | 1.199 | 1.203 | −0.4% |
| output (tok/s) | 613.7 | 616.1 | −0.4% |
| TTFT mean (ms) | 62.5 | 54.9 | +13.9% |
| TTFT p95 (ms) | 89.5 | 65.0 | +37.8% |
| ITL mean (ms) | 12.96 | 12.39 | +4.6% |
| TPOT mean (ms) | 12.44 | 12.42 | +0.2% |
| peak VRAM (MiB) | 14533 | 14020 | +513 MiB |

Notes:

- **Throughput and decode (TPOT) are at parity** — same vLLM wheel and GPU, so
  the engine's hot path is identical. modelship adds no per-token overhead.
- **TTFT/ITL** carry modelship's expected cost: the extra hop through the Ray
  Serve proxy/router adds a small *fixed* first-token latency (here ~7.6 ms) and a
  tiny per-chunk cost. Negligible for a 512-token response.
- **TTFT's tail is fatter than its mean**: p95 overhead (+37.8%) runs well above
  the mean/p50 gap (+13.9%/+1.6%) — occasional scheduling jitter through the Ray
  Serve proxy/router under concurrent load, not a fixed per-request cost. Still
  small in absolute terms (~25 ms) against a multi-second E2E latency.
- **VRAM overhead is modest** (an extra CUDA context, not KV cache). The real
  host-RAM cost is the Ray + Serve control plane (including the prewarmed
  idle-worker pool) plus the replica — but read it from `anon` in the
  per-component table below, **not** the container-RSS delta, which is dominated
  by reclaimable page cache and swings multiple GB between runs depending on which
  cgroup faulted the weights.
- Numbers are illustrative; they vary with model, hardware, load, loader, and device.

### llama_server / GPU

Example run — 1×GPU, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct Q4_K_M GGUF (fully offloaded, `n_gpu_layers: 99`),
`--loader llama_server --device gpu`, 100 prompts @ concurrency 8, greedy (`--temperature 0`), median of 3:

| metric | modelship | vanilla llama-server | overhead |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| completed / 100 | **100** | 93 | — |
| failed | **0** | 7 | — |
| throughput (req/s) | 0.495 | 0.501 | −1.2% |
| output (tok/s) | 253.5 | 256.7 | −1.2% |
| TTFT mean (ms) | 341.2 | 331.6 | +2.9% |
| TTFT p95 (ms) | 491.3 | 443.9 | +10.7% |
| ITL mean (ms) | 30.29 | 29.99 | +1.0% |
| TPOT mean (ms) | 30.2 | 29.9 | +1.0% |
| peak VRAM (MiB) | 5505 | 5372 | +133 MiB |

Notes:

- **Decode is at parity** — same `llama-server` binary and GPU, so the engine's
  hot path is identical. TPOT/ITL sit within ~1%; modelship adds no per-token cost.
- **modelship completes every request; the raw baseline drops ~7%.** Vanilla
  `llama-server`'s failures are all `ServerDisconnectedError` — the bench client
  (aiohttp) hits `llama-server`'s cpp-httplib keep-alive close behaviour directly,
  a race that Ray Serve's uvicorn front door structurally absorbs. It is **not**
  tunable away via `llama-server` flags (`--threads-http` sizes the worker pool,
  not the keep-alive lifecycle). So the baseline's small throughput/TTFT edge is
  partly **survivorship** — it decoded fewer requests. The survivorship-immune
  per-token metrics (TPOT/ITL) are the honest read, and they're at parity.
- **The load client runs greedy (`--temperature 0`).** Both arms then decode an
  identical deterministic token stream, so the A/B is reproducible and any
  *shared* engine-level in-band error appears symmetrically instead of landing on
  one arm by sampling luck. (Under sampling, `--ignore-eos` occasionally makes the
  model babble a malformed `<tool_call>` past EOS that `llama-server`'s **own**
  grammar parser rejects mid-stream — modelship faithfully relays that as an
  in-band SSE error, which greedy decoding eliminates.)
- **The result-parity gate is relative between arms**: modelship dropping or
  truncating *more* than the baseline hard-fails the run; the baseline dropping
  more (as here) is reported as a **FINDING** and the run passes. This run is a
  finding in modelship's favour — 0 drops vs 7.
- **VRAM overhead is modest** (+133 MiB, an extra CUDA context). As with vllm,
  read host-RAM cost from `anon` in the per-component table, not the container-RSS
  delta (page-cache-dominated and non-deterministic — here the baseline's `file`
  cache is actually ~4.4 GiB *higher*).
- Numbers are illustrative; they vary with model, hardware, load, loader, and device.

## How the two phases stay comparable

- Both phases use the same image (same vLLM wheel / same `llama-server` binary)
  and the same config file.
- The modelship phase runs with **`MSHIP_PREFLIGHT=false`** (passed via env). This is the linchpin: it disables hardware-aware automatic preflight tuning, ensuring that unset fields fall back to loader/pydantic defaults. Consequently, both phases run identical engine parameters out-of-the-box.
- The baseline phase parses the config through modelship's own pydantic schema
  and translates the engine config into either `vllm serve` flags
  ([`rawvllm_entrypoint.py`](rawvllm_entrypoint.py)) or a `llama-server` launch
  command ([`rawllama_entrypoint.py`](rawllama_entrypoint.py), mirroring
  `modelship/infer/llama_server/llama_server_infer.py`'s `_launch`).
- **Launch parity check**: After both phases run, the harness extracts each phase's effective launch command from its container logs, normalizes legitimately-different tokens (such as ports, hostnames, and api keys), and fails (exits non-zero) if there are any remaining differences. This guarantees that both phases run identical engine parameters.
- **Tokenizer extraction**: GGUF configs (which use GGUF model paths) cannot be used directly as Hugging Face repository IDs by the bench client. To handle this, the harness looks for a `# bench-tokenizer: <repo-id>` comment inside the yaml config file (inert to modelship) and parses it using `yaml_scalar` to use as the tokenizer for the bench client. You can also override it using the `--tokenizer` CLI flag.
- vLLM: `gpu_memory_utilization` is not a config key — modelship derives it from
  `num_gpus` (the fraction itself when `num_gpus` is fractional, else 0.9 GPU /
  0.4 CPU), and the raw phase calls the same `resolve_gpu_memory_utilization()`.
  Both phases therefore agree by construction; setting it in the yaml is now a
  hard error rather than something to keep hand-synced.
- llama_server: set `n_gpu_layers` explicitly in `configs/llama-gpu.yaml`
  (rather than the loader's `-1` auto-fit default) — the raw phase has no
  preflight to pick a matching value on its own, so an explicit, identical
  value keeps both phases offloading the same number of layers.
- llama_server on a multi-GPU host: `rawllama_entrypoint.py` sets
  `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to exactly `num_gpus` device(s) before exec'ing
  `llama-server`, mirroring the GPU reservation Ray gives the modelship
  actor. Without this the raw phase — a bare subprocess with no Ray actor —
  inherits every GPU the container's `--gpus` flag exposed, and llama.cpp
  auto-splits the model across all of them (no `--tensor-split`/`--main-gpu`
  is passed), handing the baseline more aggregate VRAM/bandwidth than the
  single-GPU modelship deploy and invalidating the comparison.
