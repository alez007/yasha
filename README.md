Modelship runs the AI stack your agents call — chat, the **Responses API** with server-side conversation state (durable with Redis), universal **tool calling**, and **reasoning**, alongside embeddings, speech, and image generation — behind one OpenAI-compatible endpoint on your own GPUs (or CPU). Built on [Ray Serve](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/index.html): state is shared across gateway replicas, deploys are declarative, and everything is observable. Point the OpenAI SDK at it and your agent runs unchanged — private, with no per-token bill.

## Why Modelship?

- **Agent state that isn't siloed per replica** — the `/v1/responses` API with reasoning, universal tool/function calling, and server-side conversation state (`previous_response_id`) live in one pluggable store shared by every gateway replica — in-memory by default, or Redis for durability across restarts and node failure. Works across both the vLLM and llama.cpp (`llama_server`) loaders.
- **Everything an agent app calls, one endpoint** — chat, embeddings for RAG, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and image generation, all behind a single OpenAI-compatible `/v1` surface. No juggling separate services for each modality.
- **Drop-in OpenAI, on your hardware** — any OpenAI SDK client works out of the box. Point it at Modelship instead of the OpenAI API and your agent code doesn't change — it just runs privately, on infrastructure you control.
- **GPU memory control** — allocate exact GPU fractions per model (e.g. 70% for the LLM, 5% for TTS) so a full stack fits on hardware you already own
- **Mix and match backends** — vLLM for high-throughput GPU or CPU inference, llama.cpp for efficient quantized GGUF models, Diffusers for images, sherpa-onnx for TTS, and whisper.cpp for STT — in the same deployment

## Architecture

  <img alt="Modelship architecture: an agent app calls the Modelship gateway's OpenAI-compatible API, which exposes chat, embeddings, audio, and image endpoints plus a Responses API backed by a shared conversation-state store, routing each request by model name to Ray Serve deployments across GPU and CPU cluster nodes." src="docs/assets/architecture-light.svg">
</picture>

Each model runs as an isolated [Ray Serve](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/index.html) deployment with its own lifecycle, health checks, and resource budget. Several inference backends are available:

| Backend | Best for | GPU required |
|---|---|---|
| **vLLM** | High-throughput chat, embeddings, transcription | No — installs on GPU or CPU |
| **llama.cpp** (`llama_server`) | High-efficiency quantized GGUF models (chat, embeddings, vision) | No |
| **Diffusers** | Image generation | Yes |
| **sherpa-onnx** | TTS (Kokoro) | No |
| **whisper.cpp** | STT | No |

Models can be deployed across multiple GPUs or run on CPU-only. A model name maps to exactly one deployment — swapping GPU/CPU or backend replaces it with a blue-green cutover rather than adding a second one alongside it. Each deployment scales horizontally with `num_replicas`, load-balanced by Ray Serve.

## Requirements

- **Docker** (or Python 3.12+ with `uv` for local development)
- **NVIDIA GPU** (optional) — 16 GB+ VRAM recommended for a full stack (LLM + TTS + STT + embeddings) via vLLM; 8 GB is sufficient for lighter setups. Not required when using the vLLM or llama.cpp backends on CPU
- **[NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html)** — required only when running GPU models in Docker
- **HuggingFace token** for gated models

## Features

- **Multi-model, multi-GPU** — run chat, embedding, STT, TTS, and image generation models simultaneously across one or more GPUs with tunable per-model GPU memory allocation
- **CPU-only support** — run models without a GPU using the vLLM or llama.cpp (`llama_server`) backends (chat, embeddings, transcription, vision). Useful for development, testing, or small models that don't need GPU acceleration
- **Multiple inference backends** — vLLM for high-throughput GPU or CPU inference, llama.cpp for efficient quantized GGUF models on CPU or GPU, Diffusers for image generation, sherpa-onnx for TTS, and whisper.cpp for STT
- **Zero-downtime hot-reloads** — modify your `models.yaml` and run a cluster reconcile; changes are applied incrementally without interrupting the API gateway or unchanged models
- **Advanced agentic capabilities** — native support for DeepSeek-style reasoning (`<think>` blocks parsed into `reasoning_content`) and universal tool/function calling across the vLLM and GGUF (`llama_server`) backends
- **Server-side MCP tool execution** — point `/v1/responses` at any self-hosted MCP server (`tools: [{"type": "mcp", ...}]`) and the gateway discovers its tools, calls them, and loops — with an approval flow (`require_approval`) client-driven tool calling doesn't have
- **Per-model isolated deployments** — each model runs in its own Ray Serve deployment with independent lifecycle, health checks, failure isolation, and configurable replica count
- **OpenAI-compatible API** — drop-in replacement for any OpenAI SDK client
- **Streaming** — SSE streaming for chat completions and TTS audio
- **Multi-GPU & hybrid deploys** — assign models to specific GPUs or run them on CPU-only; full tensor parallelism support for large models spanning multiple GPUs
- **Client disconnect detection** — cancels in-flight inference when the client disconnects, freeing GPU resources immediately
- **Security** — gateway API-key authentication (`MSHIP_API_KEYS`), Ray cluster token auth (`--ray-auth=token`), and configurable request payload/concurrency limits
- **Built-in observability** — Prometheus metrics, custom `modelship:*` metrics, vLLM engine stats, Ray cluster metrics, structured JSON logging, and OpenTelemetry log export; pre-built Grafana dashboard and alerting rules included

## Supported OpenAI Endpoints

| Endpoint | Usecase |
|---|---|
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | Chat / text generation (streaming and non-streaming) |

## Quick Start

The fastest way to try Modelship: run a tiny reasoning model on a laptop — no GPU required. Copy-paste this block and you'll have an OpenAI-compatible API on `http://localhost:8000` in a few minutes.

```bash
mkdir -p models-cache && cat > models.yaml <<'EOF'
models:
  - name: reasoning-qwen
    model: "lmstudio-community/Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF:*Q4_K_M.gguf"
    usecase: generate
    loader: llama_server
    num_cpus: 3
    llama_server_config:
      n_ctx: 4096  # Give reasoning space to think
EOF

docker run --rm --shm-size=8g \
  -v ./models.yaml:/modelship/config/models.yaml \
  -v ./models-cache:/.cache \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  ghcr.io/modelship-ai/modelship:latest-cpu deploy
```

Images are multi-arch (amd64 + arm64), so this works on Apple Silicon and ARM Linux hosts too.

Once the server is up (look for `Deployed app 'modelship' successfully`), call the **Responses API** and watch the model think:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/modelship/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "reasoning-qwen",
    "input": "Which is larger, 9.11 or 9.9?"
  }'
```

The response includes both `output_text` and a first-class `reasoning` output item — the same server-side conversation state (`previous_response_id`) and tool-calling support work here as they do on GPU-backed models. `/modelship/v1/chat/completions` remains available too, if that's what your client speaks.

### Native install (no Docker)

One install command everywhere. Pick the node's role once, when you bootstrap it:

```bash
pipx install mship          # or: uv tool install mship / pip install mship

mship bootstrap --cuda      # NVIDIA GPU node
mship bootstrap --cpu       # CPU node (includes vLLM CPU)
mship bootstrap --metal     # Apple Silicon
mship bootstrap --thin      # coordinator/head only, no capacity

mship deploy --config models.yaml
```

For a single model, skip the config file — the root-level fields have matching flags, validated by the same schema:

```bash
mship deploy --model "lmstudio-community/Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF:*Q4_K_M.gguf" \
             --loader llama_server --usecase generate --num-cpus 3
```

It serves as `qwen3-0.6b`, inferred from the reference. Several models, or the nested tuning blocks, still need a `models.yaml` — see [Single-model deploys](docs/model-configuration.md#single-model-deploys-no-config-file).

`mship bootstrap` installs a pinned Python 3.12.10 environment for that role and records it, so `deploy` afterwards needs no variant flag and installs nothing — it starts straight through. Nothing to pin and nothing to match across machines: every node lands on the same footing, so a new one joins the cluster by running the same two commands. After a `pip install -U mship`, re-run `mship bootstrap` to move the environment with it.

Platform prerequisites still apply: Xcode Command Line Tools on macOS, `build-essential`/`cmake` on Linux, plus `ninja-build` and NVIDIA's `nvcc` for `--cuda`. Alpine and other musl distros are unsupported. See [docs/install-native.md](docs/install-native.md) for the full list.

### GPU (vLLM, Diffusers)

For high-throughput GPU inference, use the `-cuda` image and add `--gpus all`. You'll also need the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) and an `HF_TOKEN` for gated models. Example `models.yaml` entries for vLLM, Diffusers, and multi-GPU setups live in [docs/model-configuration.md](docs/model-configuration.md); ready-to-run configs are in [config/examples/](config/examples/).

```bash
docker run --rm --shm-size=8g --gpus all \
  -e HF_TOKEN=your_token_here \
  -v ./models.yaml:/modelship/config/models.yaml \
  -v ./models-cache:/.cache \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  ghcr.io/modelship-ai/modelship:latest-cuda deploy
```

> [!NOTE]
> `ghcr.io/modelship-ai/modelship:latest` (bare tag, no suffix) is the **thin** control/coordinator image — no torch/vllm, for a driver/head role only. It cannot serve models by itself; always use `-cuda` or `-cpu` to actually run inference. See [docs/development.md](docs/development.md) for the full three-image breakdown.

> [!TIP]
> Always set `--shm-size=8g` (or higher) — Ray falls back to slower disk-backed storage without enough shared memory.

- [Monitoring & Logging](docs/monitoring.md) — Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboard, structured logging, health checks
- [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md) — common first-run errors and fixes

## Monitoring

Modelship exposes Prometheus metrics (Ray cluster, Ray Serve, vLLM, and custom `modelship:*` metrics) through a single scrape endpoint on port 8079. Metrics are **enabled by default** — set `MSHIP_METRICS=false` to disable. A pre-built [Grafana dashboard](docs/grafana-dashboard.json) and [Prometheus alerting rules](docs/prometheus-alerts.yml) are included in the repository.

Logging supports structured JSON output (`MSHIP_LOG_FORMAT=json`) and request ID correlation across Ray actor boundaries. Logs can be shipped to a remote syslog server (`--log-target syslog://host:514`) or an OpenTelemetry collector (`--otel-endpoint http://collector:4317`). Set `MSHIP_LOG_LEVEL` to `TRACE` for full request/response payloads, or `DEBUG` for detailed diagnostics without payloads.

See [Monitoring & Logging](docs/monitoring.md) for full details.

## Production Readiness

Modelship is actively used and designed for stability in multi-tenant setups. Key guarantees include:

- **Mutex-backed deployments:** A cluster-wide deploy coordinator prevents VRAM exhaustion by ensuring models are never loaded concurrently if resources are tight.
- **Comprehensive HTTP-level tests:** The `tests/test_*_integration.py` suites validate chat, reasoning, tool-calling, and streaming across all loaders using real (small) models.
- **Security:** Gateway API-key auth, opt-in Ray cluster token auth, and payload/concurrency limits (`MSHIP_MAX_REQUEST_BODY_BYTES`) guard against unauthenticated or oversized requests.
- **Observability:** Deep integration with Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, and structured logging, with a pre-built Grafana dashboard and Prometheus alerting rules included.

We are currently hardening the Kubernetes/KubeRay path (a Helm chart ships in [`helm/`](helm/modelship/); GPU-aware probes and gateway-level rate-limiting are next). See the full [Production Readiness Plan](docs/production-readiness.md) for the scorecard and roadmap.

## Open Responses Conformance

`/v1/responses` is also tested against the independent [Open Responses](https://github.com/openresponses/openresponses) compliance suite (`bun run test:compliance`), which exercises the endpoint over real HTTP against a live deployment rather than mocks.
